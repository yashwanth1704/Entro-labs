                                The year 2020 has thrown-out daunting challenges for global businesses. It was marked by
                                rise in the occurrence of COVID-19 cases, inordinate pressure on health care systems,
                                total disruption of transport and supplies, slowing-down of economic growth, and almost
                                a stand-still in business activity. All this meant to seek and adopt alternative
                                channels of business, and called for pacing-up of each organization's digital
                                transformation. Importantly, the pace at which the digital transformation process had to
                                be adopted and practiced was never envisioned before.
